## Hi, how are you?
Sup. I'm a Duck in a Tux (@decduck3). I do Java, C# and Javascript. I hop from project to project semi-randomly. 

Some projects I'm working on:
 - [DST GUI Mod Creator](https://github.com/decduck3/dstguimodcreator) (name in progress) a GUI app to make mods for DST
 - [take2](https://github.com/decduck3/take2), a (for now) 2D Java game engine written from scratch
